# Ina Pencil Brush
A krita resource bundle containing the pencil brush Ina created during her [【DRAWING】 Let's Learn Krita Together!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEMllwFvzgc) stream.

Disclaimer: I watched the stream 3 years after it has been published and could not find the brush anywhere. If there already is an upload somewhere, or Ina (for some reason) decided that she does not want to share the brush, please let me know. 
Disclaimer 2: I tried to have the exact same settings as Ina, but since she changed the settings a lot and very fast, there might be small differences. But in the end, it's just a template that you can use and adjust to your own needs.
